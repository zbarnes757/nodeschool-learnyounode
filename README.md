## Learning Node.js

I followed along with 13 exercises from [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/) using their `learnyounode` workshop. This was my first time working with node and my first time working back in serious Javascript since my time at DBC. 
The hardest part of this whole experience was training my brain to stop thinking in sychronous Ruby and start thinking in ascynchronous Node.js.

I included the directions for each exercise and the official answer in each file for easy review.
